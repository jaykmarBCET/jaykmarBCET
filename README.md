# 👤 Jay Kumar – Full Stack Developer | Backend Specialist | DSA Enthusiast

🚀 Passionate about crafting scalable, high-performance applications, I specialize in **backend development** using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Node.js (Express/Fastify)**, and databases including **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **SQLite**. I pair this with strong **frontend skills** in **React.js**, **Next.js**, and **React Native**, delivering full-stack solutions from concept to deployment.

💡 Currently building an AI-powered **social media platform** with **real-time features** like video/audio calling (WebRTC), posts, chats, comments, and automatic post generation. I’m also integrating services like **Cloudinary**, **Gemini**, and **Socket.IO** for enhanced functionality.

🧠 With solid foundations in **Data Structures and Algorithms** (solving 210+ problems on LeetCode), I aim to write optimized and clean code.  
📚 Constant learner, now diving deeper into **Spring Boot** and **AI integrations** for backend applications.
